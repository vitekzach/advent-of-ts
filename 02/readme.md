    [🎅Santa's reindeer,⚡Blitzen, has a secret meeting with 🎩Bernard, the head of the elves after ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher presented 🎅Santa with their a pay increase demand./]

    [⚡Blitzen] Did Santa go for it? Did he accept our Demand for a pay increase?

    [🎩Bernard] Those moron's ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher just wrote down number. I told them to write down a number.

    [⚡Blitzen] What in the actual F...

    [🎩Bernard] I know I know. You have to really spell it out for them.

    [⚡Blitzen] Alright. I'll take care of it. I'll budget 100k for each of us Reindeer. That’s enough to cover therapy for pulling Santa’s bloated cheeks across three continents, plus a little left over for a sleigh-side mojito bar.

    [🎩Bernard] I swear if I have to hold their hand anymore we're gonna put Reindeer sausage on the menu like the humans in Alaska seem to enjoy so much.

    [⚡Blitzen, agast] You realize I'm a reindeer? You gotta lay off the powered sugar bro.

    [🎩Bernard] Over my dead body. It's the only thing that makes me feel good in this nightmare of a job.

Yesterday ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher just gave number as their demand to 🎅Santa. That's not nearly specific enough. We're gonna need something much more specific.

Look at the tests. See what we can change to make them all pass.
